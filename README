# EZRepo

## Introduction

This is currently a quick-and-dirty Arch repository setup to host built AUR packages. It is
designed for use with Docker.

## Hosting

To host a repository for other machines to access you will need to host the xeno cache folder with
a web server. A docker-compose setup is provided as an example, but it should be as easy as
adding the volume for the xeno repo to the web server container.

## Repository management

To manage the respository, you will need to execute bash in the container.

### Adding an AUR package

`xeno add [aur sync options] <package name>...`

### Removing an AUR package

`xeno remove [repoctl remove options] <package name>`

### Updating packages

Packages will be updated via cronie, but can be done manually with the following commands:

`xeno update`
